## Setup

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info" role="alert"><i class="fa fa-info-circle"></i> <b>Before starting, make sure you stop Rock Band 3's emulation in RPCS3.</b> {{include.content}}</div>

If you haven't initialized your controller yet, start up Santroller.

Be sure to [[download the latest version of Santroller]](https://github.com/santroller/santroller/releases/latest){:target="_blank"}.

In the start screen, select your "`Device to program`", "`Connection Method`", and "`Device to Emulate`". This will depend on what device you're using for your drums. In the tutorial screenshots, it was a "`Raspberry Pi Pico`", "`USB Adapter`", and "`Rock Band Guitar`"  respectively.  
After selecting your options, click on `Configure`.

![A screenshot of Santroller's first screen. "Selected Device" is set to Raspberry Pi Pico and Input Type is set to "Directly Wired".](https://rb3pc.milohax.org/images/instruments/xtra/san/initgtr.png "Santroller: Initialize")

In `Controller Settings`, change the following:
* Set `Device to Emulate` to `Rock Band Guitar`
* Enable `Use USB Passthrough with RPCS3`

![A screenshot of Santroller's Controller Settings. The settings reflect exactly what is above.](https://rb3pc.milohax.org/images/instruments/xtra/san/consetgtr.png "Santroller: Controller Settings")

It's also suggested you calibrate your Whammy to have the best experience. Scroll down to the Whammy section and calibrate it.

**MAKE SURE YOU CLICK ON "`Save Settings`" before closing the program or you will lose progress!**

When you're done, close Santroller.

You can now launch Rock Band 3!

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-danger" role="alert"><i class="fa fa-exclamation-circle"></i> <b>Make sure Santroller is closed before starting Rock Band 3!!! Having Santroller open while launching Rock Band 3 will cause passthrough to fail, which means your guitar will not connect!!! </b> {{include.content}}</div>
